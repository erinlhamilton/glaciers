      	<p>These maps show our best estimate of where the southern margin of the Laurentide Ice Sheet was at various times between about 31,500 and 11,000 calendar years ago. The maps also show the extent of various lakes through that same time interval. Few of these ice-margin positions are closely constrained in time by radiocarbon or other types of dates. Positions of the ice margin and lakes during advance are particularly poorly constrained. Nearly all of the ice-margin positions shown are based on our long-distance and uncertain correlation of landscape features that mark former positions of the ice margin. Large glacial lakes are shown, but many smaller ones are not. Glacial lakes are not shown in Illinois. Note that especially after 26,000 years ago the distance of ice margin retreat and re-advance was significantly greater in Illinois and Indiana than in Wisconsin, likely because the climate was warmer to the south.</p>
      	<p><b>NOTE:</b> These maps are intended to provide a visual portrayal of the fluctuations of the southern margin of the Laurentide Ice Sheet in Wisconsin and parts of surrounding states. These maps are intended to be used at the 8½ x 11-inch page size and no larger. They are not intended to provide details that larger, more-detailed maps would provide. We suggest that these maps are best viewed as a continuous sequence. </p>

		<p>Funding provided by: Great Lakes Mapping Coalition<br>
		Data compiled by: David M. Mickelson and John W. Attig<br>
		GIS and web map by: Michael Bricknell, Steve Mauel, and Erin L. Hamilton<br>
		March 2014</p>
		<p>This new series of maps shows the chronology of the Laurentide Ice Sheet’s many advances and retreats. The maps cover Wisconsin and parts of surrounding states and show ice movement over mostly 500-year intervals (we’ve included different intervals when a significant event occurs that would otherwise be missed or when we have good controls on ice position). </p>
      	<h5>Dating ice extents</h5>
      	<p>Radiocarbon dates in Wisconsin and Illinois provide some control on the Lake Michigan Lobe initial advance. In Wisconsin, there are hardly any radiocarbon dates between about 30,000 and 16,000 calendar years ago that control ice margin positions and none at all dating advance out of the Lake Superior basin. New cosmogenic and optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dates are providing more control on ice-margin fluctuations, but they are so far limited in both number and extent. We have used crosscutting relationships of moraines, stratigraphic relationships, and available ages to assemble a series of maps that illustrate our best guess as to where the ice margin was at various times. For many of the maps there is little or no precise age control, but we hope these maps highlight important areas for future ice-sheet-chronology research. We expect them to be modified in the future as more data become available.</p>
      	<h5>Determining lake positions</h5>
      	<p>The former extents of some of the larger paleo-lakes are shown for each time slice, with extents determined by reports in the literature. They are either present or not present, but we do not vary the extent of most of the lakes. The extent of these former lakes is indicated now by the distribution of lake sediment and, in a few places, beaches. For Lakes Michigan and Superior and glacial Lakes Saginaw, Scuppernong, Oshkosh, and Yahara, paleo-lake elevations were calculated by incorporating an isostatic rebound model that calculates land surface elevations at various times in the past (Clark and others, 1994; James Clark, personal communication, 2010, 2011). For each time slice we subtracted those elevations from the present day digital elevation model (DEM). Those elevations were extrapolated onto the paleo-DEMs. </p>
